Various scripts for skin lesion detection, uses the Fastai library (v0.7)

See installation instructions [here](https://github.com/sean-mcmahon/fastai), this is my forked version of the fastai repository. Running the installation instructions there will handle all dependencies.

Replace the 'fastai' symbolic link with your own pointing towards you cloned repo of [fastai](https://github.com/sean-mcmahon/fastai) 'seans-fastai-fork/old/fastai'. Something like:
   ```
   ln -s seans-fastai-fork/old/fastai/ fastai
